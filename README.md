# Pongers
Hello, this is Omar! This game is my second on Pygame, I do hope you enjoy it! This is a remake of Pong with some added features! 1- You have the choice between singleplayer and multiplayer modes, both completed with their own music!

There are some points I'd like to briefly discuss before you proceed to try it, so please bare with me here!

Controls: 1- Singleplayer: For the first game-mode, you are in control of the left paddle. Your paddle moves with W and S for up and down respectively. The right paddle moves on its own. 

2- Multiplayer: For the second game-mode, one player commands the left paddle with W and S. The other player commands the right paddle with the UP and DOWN arrow keys. 

Other than that, its the same Pong game we all know and love!

Thank you for reading this, and enjoy the game! :)
